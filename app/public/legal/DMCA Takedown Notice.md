DMCA Takedown Notice
====================

If you believe that material available on our sites, including those hosted at BeatFork.com, infringes on your copyright(s), please notify us by submitting a DMCA notice. After we receive a valid and complete notice, we will remove the material and make a good faith attempt to contact the user who uploaded the material by email.

**You may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity infringes your copyright. ****We will [highlight such abuses](https://beatfork.com/hall-of-shame) and seek to collect those damages.**  **In addition, you are required to consider the possible fair use implications, as a result of [Lenz v. Universal](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit). We reserve the right to challenge abuses of the DMCA process, and your use of this form does not waive that right.**

**Your DMCA notice will be forwarded to the party that made the material available, and also may be sent to third parties such as **[**LumenDatabase.org**](http://www.lumendatabase.org/)**. A note will also be placed on the site in question detailing the name of the copyright owner who submitted the takedown notice.**

Please follow these steps to file a notice:

1. **Send your complaint to our designated agent via email ([dmca@beatfork.com](mailto:dmca@beatfork.com))**.

As required by the DMCA, we have a policy to terminate users that we consider to be repeat infringers. Although we won’t share the specifics of our repeat infringer policy (we don't want anyone to game the system, after all), we believe that it strikes the right balance: it protects the rights of copyright owners and protects legitimate users from wrongful termination. Please note that notices that are successfully countered, rejected on fair use grounds, or deemed to be fraudulent are not counted against a user.
