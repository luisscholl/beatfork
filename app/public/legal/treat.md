TOS Treat

Congrats! You get a treat. We hope you enjoy baking:

![Two Easter Bunny Breads](/assets/tos-treat.jpg)

These were baked following [Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/c/foodwishes)'s [Easter Bunny Easter Bread](https://youtu.be/eOzENXr_p0E) recipe with the *Braided Bread* dough from *The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook*. We would recommend skipping or grinding down the nuts and dried fruits as they make forming the bunnies difficult.
