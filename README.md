This is a rhythm game created as part of the Serious Games course at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

Its goal is to motivate people to do light exercise on a daily basis at a low cost point.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node.js v16.12.0
3. ```cd app && npm install && npm i -g generate-react-cli```
4. (optional) Install ESLint and Stylelint plugin for VS Code

## Developing

Start the development server to view the app:

```cd app && npm start```

Start the storybook server for developing components in isolation:

```cd app && npm run storybook```

Generate scaffolding for a new component:

```generate-react component MyComponent```

If you want to view the debug view for MediaPipe, create a file called .env.local in the app folder with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true
```

### Linting

If you did not install the VS Code ESLint extensions, run from app

```npx eslint src/**/* --fix```

for linting in .ts and .tsx files. With the extension eslint will be run automatically on save.

If you did not install the VS Code Stylelint extension, run from app

```npx stylelint src/**/*.scss --fix```

for linting in .scss files. With the extension stylelint will be run automatically on save.

## Building and Deployment

work-in-progress: Current steps for handing it to our tutors for grading

Run in app folder

```npm run licenses```

```npm run build```

Move license-output.md to build folder.

Copy build_README.txt to build folder.

Rename build_README.txt in build folder to README.txt

Zip build folder and upload to Moodle.

Currently there is no deployment.

## Testing

```cd app && npm test```

## Documentation

Documentation, which does not naturally fit into a comment goes into the documentation folder.
