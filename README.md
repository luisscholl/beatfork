# BeatFork

This is a rhythm game created as part of the Serious Games course at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

Its goal is to motivate people to do light exercise on a daily basis at a low cost point.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Docker
3. Start Docker
4. Install Node.js v16.12.0
5. ```cd app && npm install && npm i -g generate-react-cli```
6. (optional) Install ESLint and Stylelint plugin for VS Code
7. (optional) Install OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor plugin for VS Code

## Developing

Start everything:

1. (Windows) Start Docker Desktop
2. `npm start`

Start the development server to view the frontend:

```npm start```

Start the backend server for development:

1. (Windows) Start Docker Desktop
2. ```cd backend && npm start```

Start the storybook server for developing components in isolation:

```cd app && npm run storybook```

Generate scaffolding for a new component:

```cd app && generate-react component MyComponent```

If you want to view the debug view for MediaPipe, create a file called .env.local in the app folder with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true
```

### Linting

If you did not install the VS Code ESLint extensions, run

```npx eslint . --fix --ext .js,.mjs,.jsx,.ts,.tsx```

for linting in .js, .jsx, .ts and .tsx files. With the extension eslint will be run automatically on save.

If you did not install the VS Code Stylelint extension, run from app

```cd app && npx stylelint src/**/*.scss --fix```

for linting in .scss files. With the extension stylelint will be run automatically on save.

## Deployment

```npm run deploy```

### Backup

For backup, put 30 4 * * * docker exec mongo mongodump --out /backup/ into your crontab.

Backup will be created for the application database (MongoDB) and the Keycloak database (PostgreSQL) daily at ~/backup.

Having backup on the same server is very undesirable. The ~/backup folder only serves as a temporary location from which you can transfer backups to e.g. a backup server.

The default backup interval is once a day at 4:30 AM. You can adjust this by putting a different frequency into your crontab for the Mongo DB and docker/production.yml.

## Difficulty Estimation

As a Bachelor's thesis Luis is developing an approach to automatically estimate difficulty of levels of rhythm-based exergames like BeatFork with BeatFork as a case study. The code for that is mostly separate from the main project right now. You can find more information at difficulty-estimation/README.md.
