# Automated Difficulty Estimation in Rhythm-Based Exergames Case Study

This is code for Luis Scholl's bachelor's thesis.

## Setup

1. Setup parent project.
2. Install Python and pip (Python 3.10.x)
3. ```pipx install virtualenv```
4. Create a folder on your computer outside of the repository for virtualenv environments.
5. Create a file called .env in this folder (difficulty-estimation/) with the following content
   ```
   VIRTUALENV_PATH=<absolute path to the folder you created in the last step>
   ```
6. ```npm i```

## Developing

The MongoDB from the parent project must be running in order to use the notebook.

## Credits

See requirements.txt for a list of dependencies. As of now I am not using these for anything but private purposes, which means I do not need to give appropriate credit yet. Mid to long term I plan to include these dependencies in the credits generation script of the parent project.
