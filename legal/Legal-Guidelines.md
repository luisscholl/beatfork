### Requesting Private Information of BeatFork.com Users

Our users place their trust in us to keep them safe, and, in some cases, anonymous. We view safeguarding that trust and protecting our users’ private information as vital to what we do. Luis Scholl receives requests for information about BeatFork.com users from government agencies, law enforcement, private parties, and individuals or corporations involved in civil lawsuits. Before revealing any non-public information about a user we require a valid subpoena, search warrant, or court order. The only exception is when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency involving imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.

If your inquiry or request brings to our attention a violation of our policies or [Terms of Service](https://beatfork.com/tos/), we will address it per our usual procedure. This may or may not include contacting the user, removing content, or suspending the user entirely.

More information about our procedures is below.

### What Information Do We Have?

BeatFork.com has certain information relating to users. BeatFork.com accounts contain various information that is provided at a user’s discretion and is unverified. The following is a summary of the information that we may collect and store.

1.  _Basic account information, such as:_

*   Username
*   Email address


3.  _Level creation, publicizing, and revision history information, such as:_

*   The date and time (UTC) at which a level was created

We may retain the above information, even if a level or comment.

### Requests from Government Agencies/Law Enforcement

We do not voluntarily provide governments with access to data about users for any reason, including for the purposes of law enforcement, intelligence gathering, or other surveillance. As noted above, we only provide information to third parties after receiving a valid subpoena, search warrant, or court order. The only exception is for emergency requests by law enforcement where we have a good faith belief that the information is necessary to prevent imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. In response to a valid subpoena issued by a authority, we can provide the following information, when it is available:

*   Email address currently assigned to a user

We require a specific court order or search warrant before providing additional IP address data or information relating to a specific level or level comment.

### Requests in Civil Cases

In a civil matter, it is our policy to turn over private user information only upon receipt of either (1) a valid order from a court in Germany; or (2) a subpoena served from a court in the Germany as part of an existing lawsuit.

### Notification to BeatFork.com Users and Transparency

We aim for total transparency with our users when legal requests for information or complaints affect their accounts, or information. It is our policy to notify users and provide them with a copy of any legal requests regarding their account unless we are prohibited from doing so by a court order issued in Germany. When the prohibition from notifying users expires, we will notify users and provide them with a copy of the legal process at that time. If a request for information is validly issued, as described above in these Legal Guidelines, we will preserve the necessary information before informing the user of the request. In most cases, upon notification to the user of the request for information, that user will be provided with either 7 days or the amount of time before the information is due, whichever is later, during which time the user may attempt to quash or legally challenge the request. If, prior to the deadline, we receive notice from the user that he or she intends to challenge a request for information, we will not deliver any information until that process concludes. We also review the information requests received and may lodge our own challenge to the scope or validity of legal process received, on behalf of a user, whether or not the user pursues his/her own legal challenge.

### Withdrawing Requests

If a legal request is formally withdrawn before we provide user information in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, or court order, we will not notify the user if requested to keep the withdrawn legal process confidential.

### Serving Process on BeatFork.com and Making Inquiries

Any request for user information must include a valid email address for us to return the information or contact with questions. We are unable to process overly broad or vague requests for information. To request information for a user on BeatFork.com, the request must specifically include identifying information such as the relevant level, email address, or username at issue. To obtain information for a specific level or comment, the URL of that level or comment must be included in the request.  BeatFork.com communicates only via email. Where permitted, we accept service via email to legal@beatfork.com. General inquiries regarding our policies can be sent via email to legal@beatfork.com.

### Requests for Takedown of Content

BeatFork.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. When we receive a request to takedown content, we review those complaints very carefully.  

### Reporting Terms of Service Violations

If you believe that a site is violating our Terms of Service, please contact us via email at [legal@beatfork.com](mailto:legal@beatfork.com). Regardless of whether or not we take action, we may forward a copy of the complaint to the user. We do not remove content based on disputes over the content on a site or in a comment, unless the information sought to be removed is subject to an order issued by a court in Germany. We are not in a position to determine if something posted on BeatFork.com is defamatory or not. If we receive such a complaint, we defer to the judgment of a court in Germany.

### A Note on Back Doors and Encryption

We furnish user information to third parties via the processes described in these Legal Guidelines. We do not provide access to user data through “back doors” in our systems. Similarly, we support and promote encryption of user data. We encrypt all traffic (serve over SSL) for all BeatFork.com sites, by default. Some governments have recently sought to weaken encryption in the name of law enforcement. We disagree with these suggestions and do not believe that it is feasible to include any deliberate security weaknesses or other back doors in encryption technologies, even if “only” for the benefit of law enforcement. [As a wise man said](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/09/crypto-wars-redux-why-the-fbis-desire-to-unlock-your-private-life-must-be-resisted), “there is no such thing as a vulnerability in technology that can only be used by nice people doing the right thing in accord with the rule of law.” We agree wholeheartedly.
