# User Guidelines

To be transparent about what is and isn’t allowed on your site, we’ve put together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn’t allowed on BeatFork.com.

Self-explanatory.

**Intellectual property infringement.**

BeatFork.com is a platform for playing the open source rhythm based exergame BeatFork and exchanging levels for said game. Do not provide any content, which could infringe intellectual property rights.

**Pornography.**

We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts. Nudity, in and of itself, is fine.

**Gambling.**

Don't link or mention gambling sites.

**Technologically harmful content.**

Please don’t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.

**Impersonation.**

**Directly threatening material.**

Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence—or death—against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn’t mean that we’ll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.

**Posting private information.**

Don’t share someone’s personal information without their consent. This includes collecting sensitive information in Contact Forms such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.

**Advertising.**

Advertising isn’t permitted.com Plan that allows ad networks.

**Spam**

You know what this is.

Bear in mind that these are just guidelines — interpretations are solely up to us. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

If you believe a BeatFork.com user has violated our Terms of Service or any of these policies, please report the user. We aim to promptly review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation. We may also contact the user to inform him/her of the complaint.

If we’re not in a position to make a determination (for example, whether something is defamatory or not), we defer to the judgment of a court.
