Cookie Policy
=============

Our [Privacy Policy](https://beatfork.com/privacy/) explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies"). Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

### **How we use cookies**

We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the "like" button on a level, for example). Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered BeatFork.com user (so you don’t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account. For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below.

### **Where we place cookies**

We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services. These include:

*   On our websites (including BeatFork.com, auth.BeatFork.com, backend.BeatFork.com).

### **Types of Cookie**

The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.

|Category of cookies|Why we use these cookies|
|---|---|
|Required|These cookies are essential for our websites and services to perform basic functions and are necessary for us to operate certain features. These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account-related functions, store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location, and ensure our services are operating properly.|
|Analytics and Performance|These cookies allow us to optimize performance by collecting information on how users interact with our websites, including which pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data. We use these details to improve how our websites function and to understand how users interact with them.|
|Level Analytics|These cookies allow us to optimize level difficulty estimation. We use these details to improve how our level difficulty estimation functions and to understand how users interact with levels. Collected data will be used in an anonymized form in a Bachelor's thesis by Luis Scholl.|

### Examples

Below are examples of the cookies set by Luis Scholl, with explanations of their purpose. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative. Information about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our authentication provider, is below.

#### Controlling Cookies

Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly. To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org. For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising visit [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu) (EU based) or [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info) (US based). 

On a mobile device, you may also be able to adjust your settings to limit tracking.

### Our Analytics Tool

We use Matomo On-Premise as our analytics tool.

In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards.  We use this information to improve our services, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our [Privacy Policy](http://beatfork.com/privacy/). You may opt out of our analytics program through the settings. By doing so, you won’t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your BeatFork.com account. Note that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track - for example, if you publish a level, we will still have record of that (don’t worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool.
